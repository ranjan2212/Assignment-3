    "\n",
    "Reusability: This is especially useful for code that is used frequently, such as code for performing common tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions can be used to create modules of code that are self-contained and independent of the rest of the program. This makes it easier to debug and maintain the code.\n",

    "Testability: Functions can be easily tested in isolation, which can help to identify and fix bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: Functions can be optimized for performance and improve the speed of the program.\n",
    "Overall, functions are a powerful tool that can make your programs more readable, reusable, modular, testable, and performant.\n",
